REGION OF INTEREST DATASET USED: 

Harvard-Oxford (HO): The HO atlas distributed with FSL is split into cortical and subcortical probabilistic atlases. A 25% threshold was applied to each of these atlases and they were subsequently bisected into left and right hemispheres at the midline (x=0). ROIs representing left/right WM, left/right GM, left/right CSF and brainstem were removed from the subcortical atlas. The subcortical and cortical ROIs were combined and then fractionated into functional resolution using nearest-neighbor interpolation.

Step 3: Download both 'Atlas' and 'Labels'

Step 4: It is recommended to create a virtual environment and have a dedicated directory for these data. Save in file system and go to back to mROI-ABIDE and run img_overlay.py

  source ./micromamba/envs/extraction
  
  data_directory ./micromamba/envs/extraction/ABIDE
