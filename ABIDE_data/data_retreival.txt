      Things worth noting:
 
 -The data is available to the public through the Amazon S3 bucket and can only be accessed using HTTP. 
 Each file needs to be accessed by its literal name. I did everything through CLI, but there are GUIs available for MacOS X and Windows.
 I have a Linux system, so CLI made sense for me. 
 
 -SYNTAX usign download_abide_prepoc.py found in github.com/preprocessed-connectomes-project:

 -It's best practice to create a virtual environment so you don't mess with dependencies locally. I made mine through conda CLI.
 My virtual environment name is 'extraction' and directory is: ~/micromamba/envs/extraction
 
 -Once you have your virtual environment and are in working directory:
 
  Step #1
  
  in CLI: $ sudo apt install awscli
  
  Step #2
  
  in CLI: $ python download_abide_preproc.py -d anat -p cpac -s noproj -o ~/micromamba/envs/extraction/data -a -c

<pipeline>  use the CPAC pipeline for preprocessing. The Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (CPAC) is a configurable software pipeline for the preprocessing and analysis of resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data. It is designed to be flexible and can be configured for a variety of analysis workflows, such as preprocessing with different software packages and pipelines, nuisance regression, functional connectivity analysis, and more.

CPAC has been widely used in the field of connectomics and has been shown to produce high-quality preprocessing results. One of the strengths of CPAC is its configurability, which allows users to tailor the preprocessing and analysis workflows to their specific research questions and data characteristics.

So, CPAC is a commonly used pipeline for preprocessing and analyzing resting-state fMRI data and can be used for a wide range of applications.

<strategy> use the no-projection strategy for preprocessing. The no projection strategy in preprocessing refers to a method where a participant's functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is not regressed against any confounding variables such as head motion or global signal. This is in contrast to other preprocessing strategies such as global signal regression or regression of motion parameters, which aim to remove unwanted variance from the data.

The decision to use a particular preprocessing strategy is often based on the research question being investigated and the potential impact of different preprocessing methods on the results. In general, the no projection strategy may be preferred when investigating specific neural systems or regions that are less susceptible to the effects of head motion or other confounds. However, it is important to note that the no projection strategy may also introduce artifacts and other sources of noise into the data, and should be used with caution depending on the research question and specific study design.
