My independent research statement is focused on demonstrating the feasibility of developing a computer vision algorithm to automatically detect and classify anatomical landmarks related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using biomedical imaging data. 

The implementation of a support vector machine algorithm is a step towards proving that such a tool can be made and used as an automated diagnostic tool for ASD. The evaluation of the anatomical landmarks in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange is an important part of this process, as it allows for a comprehensive understanding of the regions of interest and the potential indicators of ASD. By demonstrating the feasibility of such a tool, the aim is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ASD diagnosis, which can lead to more effective interventions and better outcomes for individuals with ASD.
