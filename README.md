# **Autism Brain Classification using Support Vector Machines**

This project aims to create a classification algorithm to identify anatomical differences in autistic brains compared to control conditions using support vector machines (SVM) in scikit-learn. The input data is preprocessed functional MRI (fMRI) files in NIfTI format (.nii.gz), which will be downloaded from the ABIDE dataset.

**Special thanks to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, an open-source initiative that made this project   possible:**

##**Setting up a Conda Virtual Environment**

1. Install Miniconda or Anaconda if you haven't already. You can download it from [HERE](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 

2. Create a new virtual environment called 'extraction':

```
conda create -n extraction python=3.8
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```
conda activate extraction
```

4. Install the required packages in the virtual environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Downloading ABIDE Data**

1. Download the 'download_abide_preproc.py' script from the [Preprocessed Connectomes Project's ABIDE repository](https://github.com/preprocessed-connectomes-project/abide)

2. Download the data using the download_abide_preproc.py script as mentioned in the 'data_retrieval.txt' file in the project directory ABIDE_data/data_retrieval.txt. Make sure to download the data into the 'Outputs' folder.

## **Dependencies**

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## **Data Preparation**

Organize the data into separate folders for autistic and control groups using the provided Python script:

```
python organize_data.py
```

This script will create two folders `data/autistic` and `data/control`, and move the respective `.1D` and `.nii.gz` files into the appropriate group folders. 

## **Running the Classification Algorithm**

Once you have prepared the data, you can run the classification algorithm using the provided script:

```
python classify_brain.py
```

This script will load the data from the 'data/autistic' and 'data/control' folders, perform feature extraction, and train a Support Vector Machine classifier to distinguish between autistic and control conditions. The results will be displayed as classification accuracy, precission, recall, and F1-score.

## **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on this repository, and we will try to address it as soon as possible.
