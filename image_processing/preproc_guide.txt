Follow the rest of the prompts until you can download the installer. 

I'd recommend creating a new virtual environment, I called mine image_analysis and stored it here: ~/micromamba/envs/image_analysis
Save 'fslinstaller.py' in that directory. Once that's done, go ahead and run $ python3 fslinstaller.py

*NOTE: It will ask you to confirm where in the directory you'd like to save the program. finish
